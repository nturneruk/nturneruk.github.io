# Taking a leap - JNCIA-JUNOS

I will be going into my last year of A-Levels in September. Once I have finished these, I will be looking for an apprenticeship in Network Engineering. Therefore, I am looking for ways to boost my CV. 

So, I've decided to take the plunge and start studying for the JNCIA-Junos exam. Althouh you have to be 18 to take the exam itself, ther's nothing stopping me from covering the content and then revising it all once I turn 18 next year. 

I will keep this blog posted, as a way to keep track of my own learning throughout the certification. 

Wish me luck ;)
