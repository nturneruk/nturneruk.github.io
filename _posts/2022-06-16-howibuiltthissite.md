# How I Built This Site

This site is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. Jekyll is not only useful for blogs, such as this one, but also for documentation sites, as well as most other types of website. 

My site uses the Chirpy theme, which is built by Cotes2020 on GitHub.

In order to get my site into the state it is currently, I followed Techno Tim's walk through, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q).

In order to configure my site and add posts, I use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and run Ubuntu 20.04 as of June 2022. In order to edit the config files & create posts, I use VSCode. 

Obviously, I host my site through GitHub, as it is free, has excellent availalbility rates. It also allows me to use the GitHub actions created by Cotes, used for pushing posts etc. to GitHub. 

All of my posts are written in markdown format (.md).
