# Vodafone's Eco Friendly Masts

On the 15th of June, Vodafone released a press release regarding the switching on of both their, and the UK's, first "self powered" mobile phone mast. If you are interested, you can read that article [HERE](https://newscentre.vodafone.co.uk/press-release/uk-first-self-powering-mobile-phone-mast-live-wales/).

This mast will provide 4G service in in Eglwyswrw, in Pembrokeshire. 

The mast itself is powered by renewable energy sources, namely wind and solar power. 

The benefits to this mast could be plentiful, such as:

- The fact that it can be installed without requiring trenches to be built for electricity cables, making it both faster to install, and reducing its impact ont he local environment.
- The fact that the mast is quiet, potentially allowing it to be installed in sensitive sites, e.g. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 
- It's renewable energy sources will help to comabt the use of non-renewable enrgy sources, as well as having a positive impact on climate change. 
- In addition, due to the self powered nature, not only can it be installed in rural areas here in the UK, but also in developing countries, where there power infrastructure is not stable or of good quality. This will then reduce the technological inequalities faced by these communities. 

Overall, I think that this is a very positive move by Vodafone, and hope other carriers follow suit.
